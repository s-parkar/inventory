# Inventory Management System - Feature List

## 1. Core Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python Flask (Modular "Blueprints" Architecture).
- **Frontend**: HTML5 + Tailwind CSS (Clean, Modern, Responsive).
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security (RLS).
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (Email/Password).

## 2. Architecture & Code Quality
- **Modular Structure**: Code turned into a package (`app/`) with separate modules for `auth`, `inventory`, `admin`, `supplier`, and `devops`.
- **Application Factory**: Uses `create_app()` pattern for better scalability and testing.
- **Environment Config**: Uses `.env` for sensitive keys and versioning.

## 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **User Roles Support**: Admin, Supplier, and User.
- **Dynamic Redirection**:
  - Admins -> Admin Dashboard
  - Suppliers -> Supplier Dashboard
  - Users -> Standard Inventory Dashboard
- **Security**: Routes protected by `@before_request` checks ensuring only correct roles access their pages.

## 4. Role-Specific Features
### A. Admin (`/admin`)
- **System Overview**: View all registered users and their roles.
- **Audit Logs**: View real-time system logs (who did what).
- **Full Control**: Ability to delete any product from the system.

### B. Supplier (`/supplier`)
- **Product Management**: Exclusive interface to Add New Products.
- **My Listings**: View only products they have added.
- **Revenue/Stock**: See price and stock levels for their items.

### C. User / Buyer (`/inventory`)
- **Shopping Interface**: View all available products.
- **Simulate Purchase**: "Buy" button decrements stock in real-time.
- **Stock Status**: Visual indicators for "In Stock", "Low Stock", and "Out of Stock".

## 5. DevOps & Observability (Demo Ready)
- **Health Check (`/health`)**: JSON endpoint showing DB connection status.
- **Metrics (`/metrics`)**: Prometheus-compatible text metrics for monitoring.
- **Chaos Engineering (`/simulate_error`)**: Button to intentionally crash the app to test alerting pipelines.
- **Versioning**: App version displayed in footer (loaded from env).

## 6. Security (Database Level)
- **RLS Policies**: SQL policies ensure data is only accessible to authenticated users.
- **Foreign Keys**: `supplier_id` links products to users; `user_id` links roles to users.
